Example Project: Testing PWM Signal from Arduino
Objective:
Generate a PWM signal from the Arduino and visualize it using the DSO138 oscilloscope.
Sample Code for Arduino:
cpp
CopyEdit
int pwmPin = 9; // PWM output pin

Testing the Signal on DSO138
1.	Power Up:
o	Connect the oscilloscope to a 9V power supply or USB port.
2.	Connect Probes:
o	Attach the oscilloscope probes to the signal pin (PWM output) and GND on the Arduino.
3.	Configure Oscilloscope:
o	Set the time base (horizontal scale) to observe the PWM waveform clearly.
o	Adjust the voltage scale (vertical scale) to match the signal's amplitude.
4.	Observe the Waveform:
o	The oscilloscope should display a square wave corresponding to the PWM signal with:
	Amplitude: ~5V (for Arduino Uno's logic level).
	Duty Cycle: 50% (as set in the code).
	Frequency: Arduino's default PWM frequency (~490 Hz for most pins).
